                           <p>What if I told you <strong>there is nothing you cannot be, do, or have?</strong> </p>
 
													<p>Perhaps reading that sentence immediately brings up self-doubt and fear.</p>

													<p>I know how it feels to question that statement, in fact, my brain, and maybe yours too, comes up with hundreds of excuses. But all those are, are limiting beliefs.  </p>
													
													<p>Those limiting beliefs are thoughts, and thoughts can be changed. </p> 
													
													<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Have you ever asked yourself why you believe your own thoughts? </p> 
													<p>No, but really, what makes them true? The fact that you thought them? The fact that they exist?</p>  
													
													<p>The amazing thing is that our thoughts create our feelings, and our feelings feed into our thoughts. It's a cycle. So, the only way to interrupt that cycle, is to consciously change our thoughts.  </p>
													
													<p>What would happen if you allowed yourself to believe that everything is possible? Even if the world around you doesn't agree, or holds you back, or doesn't have the same drive and desire as you. All that matters is that <strong>YOU</strong> do. </p> 

													<p>Our experiences on a day to day basis and a moment to moment basis, are entirely dependent on our thoughts. If our thoughts are constantly negative, chances are, our experiences will be negative too. </p>

                            Yup, ever. That's a strong statement right? But, it helped me feel understood in a way I never have before.

                            <p>And as a kid, you sang, danced, drew, moved, cried, smiled, laughed, ran naked, and most likely did all those
                                things passionately. </p>

                            <p>Then you started to grow up, and perhaps the adults around you didn't encourage your ... </p>
