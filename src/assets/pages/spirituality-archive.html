                    <p>I taught a meditation class this week around the practice of this Hawaiian form of reconciliation and forgiveness,
                        so I thought I would share it with you because it has become one of my favorite meditations. </p>

                    <p>Similarly to how you would repeat a mantra (a word, sound, or statement repeated to aid concentration) over and over
                        again during a meditation, the Ho'oponopono practice is the repetition of the following: </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>"I'm sorry</strong> </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Please forgive me,</strong> </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Thank you,</strong> </p>
                    <p><strong>I love you".</strong> </p>

                    <p>With each of the 4 phrases, allow yourself to pause, and feel the words. Different thoughts or feelings might come
                        up, allow them to arise. Let yourself feel. </p>
                    <p>It's a healing practice, and each time you ... </p>

                          <p>I want to tell you the story of how scary meditation was for me, for the longest time.  </p>
 
                        <p>I believe that it can be intimidating for most people, especially without any guidance. </p>
                        
                        <p>But first, let me share with you the story of how I rejected Yoga many years ago, and how it has now transformed my life. </p>
                        
                        <p>When I was a young girl, I remember waking up on the weekend and seeing my mom do all kinds of fitness activities in the living room. Sometimes, this involved yoga.  </p>
                        
                        <p>I was never really curious about it, but then, around the age of 9 or 10, I went along with her to a class at a community center near our house.  </p>
                        
                        <p>I.hated.it. </p>
                        
                        <p>I tried it again a few years later…still a no-go. </p>
                        
                        <p>And again in my late teenage years, still hated it. </p>
                        
                        <p>Yes, hate is a very strong word. And that's what I felt at the time. I didn't understand it then, but the practice was forcing me to be present in my body, and I was absolutely not ready for that.  I even remember spending the whole class looking ... </p>

                          <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">One of the most famous Yoga, dance and music festivals is Shakti Fest, held in Joshua Tree, southern California. </p>
 
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">It was my first time attending this type of event, and it was one of the best 3 days of my life.  </p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Before I dive into the beautiful details, I thought I'd share what Shakti means. According to Wikipedia: <strong>Shakti</strong>, meaning power or empowerment, is the primordial cosmic energy and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire universe. <strong>Shakti</strong> is the concept of <strong>divine feminine</strong> creative power, sometimes referred to as 'The Great Divine Mother'. </p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Ironically this year, the festival landed on Mother's day. </p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">As soon as we arrived (it was about an 8 hour -gorgeous- drive from Silicon Valley), I cried. Nothing had even happened yet, but the sight ... </p>
