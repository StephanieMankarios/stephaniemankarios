				<p>Following yoga classes with Steph changed my life. When I began three years ago, I was slowly recovering from multiple fractures in my ankle, had recurrent back pain, and was absolutely not flexible. <br><br>
					
					Since then, this has greatly improved. I have no more back pain, my ankle is almost as good as new, and I can touch my toes! ;o) <br><br>
					
					Other than the physical benefits of taking up yoga with Steph, going to class each week was like pressing the “reset button” mentally. Exit the stress of the previous week and everyday worries… I always come out of Steph’s classes with a great feeling of serenity. <br><br>
					
					It is with warmth and smiles that I recommend Steph as a yoga teacher! <br><br>

				<p>Being someone who always wants to be better and get better, I'm always looking for something that could help me reach my goals. It never occurred to me that having a personal development coach would make such a big difference, but it has. Through Stephanie's coaching, her personal messages, and her Instagram challenges, I've come to understand how to grow towards a better version of me. The challenges she's put me through so far have proven to me that with appropriate effort, I can change. For example, something as simple as looking in the mirror and saying "I love you" has helped me accept myself (physically and mentally). I thank her for her simplicity, because through that simplicity I have unravelled complex mechanisms in my mind, heart, and body, and I feel better.  <br><br>

	<p>Stephanie is an amazing yoga teacher! Adapting her classes to students of all levels and always challenging us with different poses.

						<p>Stephanie was my first yoga teacher and she got me hooked!  Her warmth and calmness make everyone feel right at home. She welcomes all into her class with a warm hello and will often ask if anyone needs anything specific for the practice and will adjust accordingly. Her classes are well balanced with just enough challenges and always end with a relaxation. Every week I leave yoga class feeling great and I bring home an inner calmness that helps me throughout the hectic week to come. - Julie M.</p>

				<p>I have known Stephanie for over 2 years and have found her to be honest, reliable, hard working, and conscientious.  <br><br>
Her skills and abilities as a yoga teacher are unparalleled for someone at such a young age.  
Her attention to details and knowledge of the human body bring her classes to another level, physically, mentally and spiritually.  <br><br>
I would highly recommend that anyone try just one class with Stephanie, I guarantee that it would not be the last.  <br><br> 
Yours faithfully,  <br>

				<p>I have had the honour of having Stephanie as a coach as well as a yoga teacher, and she has helped me transform my life in more ways than I can describe. She is attentive, caring and passionate. I have been able to make changes in my life after years of leading a stressful and unhappy life. I am forever grateful to her for everything she has helped me see and change.

				<p>I tried Stephanie Mankarios' yoga class initially because I was looking for something that would provide some balance to a busy work, gym, family life... something other than "workout yoga". I'd done plenty of that elsewhere. <br>
				Stephanie's class challenged me physically into postures that I never thought I could do, encouraged me to go within with daily meditations, reminded me to focus on my breath, let go of my ego and quiet my busy mind. <br>
				The result was a feeling of complete serenity and wellness. <br>
				One of her strengths is her focus on proper alignment and technique. Throughout the class she offers suggestions for minor adjustments that can change a posture into something that feels just right. <br>
				I absolutely recommend her classes to anyone. Stephanie is an instructor above par. Her passion for yoga and teaching has enriched my practice tremendously. <br><br>

				<p>I tried yoga in the past and did not like it. 
				<br><br>
				Then for years, my husband tried to convince me to join yoga with his teacher: Steph. 
				Thinking I was too busy and with my previous yoga experience, I procrastinated for over 2 years... What a mistake!! 
				<br><br>
				Then after a few months of high stress and anxiety in my life, I decided to try the class and I was hooked :) 
				<br><br>
				Steph is an amazing yoga teacher and a wonderful person altogether! She has sound knowledge of anatomy, her voice is mesmerizing, her approach is soothing and the passages she reads to us are inspiring. 
				<br><br>
				Her yoga class has done wonders in helping me to relax and breathe better. I recommend yoga with Steph with all my heart.

				<p>What do we expect from a teacher... We expect a person who is a professional, knowledgeable and helpful. I started yoga with no expectations four years ago. Like most, I wanted to get into shape, lower my stress levels and have more energy. I really did not understand yoga at all. I liked the movement and the sense of peace after a good workout. Thankfully Stephanie was there.. What I know today, is that yoga can transform you, it is subtle, the physical starts to manifest. You can work in your backyard all day and not feel tired or have back pain, then the sense of empowerment creeps in, you feel better, and because you feel better you hold yourself better and look better.  The mind relaxes, the chatter stops, you become a better listener, and because you are able to be present in your everyday activities, it becomes part of you. You slow down, the kids notice, the husband notices, the friends and work colleagues notice and life seems different. You are in control, your body is strong, you have stamina, but mostly you can find stillness in the most hectic of moments. This can be life changing.  <br><br>
 
So ask yourself,  who do I trust, with my body and even if you are willing, my mind? <br><br>
 
The ability to guide a person from having difficulty to touch their toes, to being able to do 108 sun salutations in three hours is the result of being a dedicated and disciplined instructor and is not a given ( if you have ever been to several different yoga classes you have already come to this realization).  <br>
Stephanie is a true yoga teacher in every aspect of the discipline, her anatomical knowledge is advanced, even health professionals trusts her to guide them in the most difficult  poses. 
Stephanie teaches in a manner that is respectful and this is shared in her classes, everyone regardless of shape and ability, is important, the practice she creates is so fluid and full of trust that you are able to abandon yourself (this is very important in a class if you cannot abandon yourself in your yoga class you will never evolve). Her classes become a very safe place, people look forward to arriving. I have witnessed her guide groups of 6 and 36 everyone connected within and abandoned in their practice. Her workout is uncompromising, challenging for any advanced yogi or beginner and she is fun.  If you are open and willing, she can truly bring you to a physical and mental place you may never have thought possible. <br><br>
