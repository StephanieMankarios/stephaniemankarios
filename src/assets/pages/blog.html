                          <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">One of the most famous Yoga, dance and music festivals is Shakti Fest, held in Joshua Tree, southern California. </p>
 
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">It was my first time attending this type of event, and it was one of the best 3 days of my life.  </p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Before I dive into the beautiful details, I thought I'd share what Shakti means. According to Wikipedia: <strong>Shakti</strong>, meaning power or empowerment, is the primordial cosmic energy and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire universe. <strong>Shakti</strong> is the concept of <strong>divine feminine</strong> creative power, sometimes referred to as 'The Great Divine Mother'. </p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Ironically this year, the festival landed on Mother's day. </p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">As soon as we arrived (it was about an 8 hour -gorgeous- drive from Silicon Valley), I cried. Nothing had even happened yet, but the sight ... </p>

                          <p>One of the most common difficulties I see in people is the fear to FEEL. </p>

                            <p>As a culture, it seems we are becoming more in touch with our logic/rational selves and pushing away, even rejecting our emotional selves.  </p>

                            <p>The thing is, it's hurting us. The one thing I get asked the most often is "please help me feel again".  </p>
                            
                            <p>My entire approach to teaching Yoga is about staying present with the feelings and sensations that arise within us as we move or stay still within the asanas (postures). </p>

                            <p>The interesting thing is, we store all of our experiences in our body, and if we never learn to release them, they stay stuck. Then, we develop dis-ease, aches, pains, and injuries worsen or continue to reoccur. The link between the body and the mind is</p>

              <p>I recently started working with a Functional Health Practitioner (best decision I ever made btw, and after running some tests, we uncovered that my gut is…in the least scary terms possible, not in such good shape</p>

              <p>I have 2 things: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>A parasite called Blastocystis hominis (yuck, right?). According to Wikipedia, it is one of the most common
                  human parasites in the world, and is THE most common parasitic infection in the United States. </li>

                <li>Candida Albicans, which is a fungus, is detectable in the gastrointestinal tract in 40% of healthy adults,
                  according to wikipedia. </li>
              </ul>

                           <p>For a long time, there was a stigma around therapy. I even noticed this when recently watching an episode of  Gilmore Girls (yes you can laugh at me:), where Lorelai said "A therapist? Why, have you gone crazy?" </p>
 
<p>There was this idea that you either needed to be "crazy" to see a therapist, or something really bad had to happen to you. </p> 
 
<p>The truth is, everyone can benefit from therapy. </p> 
 
<p>And here are 3 reasons why: </p>
 
<p><strong>1. We all need help to dig deeper </strong></p>
 
<p>Let's face it, as much as some of us have really close people with whom we can share everything with, you can only go so far with a friend or family member.  </p>
 
<p>Of course, we all have that one caring person in our lives that would listen to us until the world ended, but the truth is, without proper training, no one can REALLY help us the way someone with a trained background can. </p>
 
<p>Seeing a therapist, coach, psychologist, counselor or psychiatrist can really be beneficial in order to ... </p>

                            <p>Then we; roll out of bed until we hit the floor, walk blindly to the bathroom to pee, make our way to the kitchen for some liquid caffeine to jolt us back into awareness, and possibly eat some breakfast.  </p>

                            <p>Maybe it's a change in lifestyle, a change in how you do certain things or a change in the way you think. Perhaps you've adopted a new way of thinking but your actions don't quite match your thoughts yet.</p>

                            <p>Regardless of the reason or nature of the change, we all know the feeling of wanting to change something in our lives and never getting around to it or feeling unable to do it.</p>

                            <p>Before we get right into it, let's explore the idea that there are 3 kinds of people when it comes to change:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                            <span>Those who don't want to change and never change</span></li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                            <span>Those who look for change but don't change</span></li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                            <span>Those who want to change and do it</span></li>
