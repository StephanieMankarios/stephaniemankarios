                            <p>I never imagined the extent to which sugar was affecting my life, until I stopped it. </p>


              <p>And trust me, I really didn't think I was eating much sugar to begin with. </p>


              <p>Now you might be thinking…why the heck would you completely stop eating sugar (it's in almost everything),right?</p>


              <p>Well friend, here is my story: </p>

              <p>I recently started working with a Functional Health Practitioner (best decision I ever made btw, and after running some tests, we uncovered that my gut is…in the least scary terms possible, not in such good shape</p>

              <p>I have 2 things: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>A parasite called Blastocystis hominis (yuck, right?). According to Wikipedia, it is one of the most common
                  human parasites in the world, and is THE most common parasitic infection in the United States. </li>

                <li>Candida Albicans, which is a fungus, is detectable in the gastrointestinal tract in 40% of healthy adults,
                  according to wikipedia. </li>
              </ul>

              <p>Yup, scary, I know.</p>

              <p><strong>The good news is</strong>, I can get rid of these by ... </p>

                           <p>For a long time, there was a stigma around therapy. I even noticed this when recently watching an episode of  Gilmore Girls (yes you can laugh at me:), where Lorelai said "A therapist? Why, have you gone crazy?" </p>
 
<p>There was this idea that you either needed to be "crazy" to see a therapist, or something really bad had to happen to you. </p> 
 
<p>The truth is, everyone can benefit from therapy. </p> 
 
<p>And here are 3 reasons why: </p>
 
<p><strong>1. We all need help to dig deeper </strong></p>
 
<p>Let's face it, as much as some of us have really close people with whom we can share everything with, you can only go so far with a friend or family member.  </p>
 
<p>Of course, we all have that one caring person in our lives that would listen to us until the world ended, but the truth is, without proper training, no one can REALLY help us the way someone with a trained background can. </p>
 
<p>Seeing a therapist, coach, psychologist, counselor or psychiatrist can really be beneficial in order to ... </p>

<p>Then we; roll out of bed until we hit the floor, walk blindly to the bathroom to pee, make our way to the kitchen for some liquid caffeine to jolt us back into awareness, and possibly eat some breakfast.  </p>

<p>Maybe it's a change in lifestyle, a change in how you do certain things or a change in the way you think. Perhaps you've adopted a new way of thinking but your actions don't quite match your thoughts yet.</p>

<p>Regardless of the reason or nature of the change, we all know the feeling of wanting to change something in our lives and never getting around to it or feeling unable to do it.</p>

<p>Before we get right into it, let's explore the idea that there are 3 kinds of people when it comes to change:</p>
